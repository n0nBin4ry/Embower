The game was developed in Unity 2018.3.0f2.

These are all the files of the "final" version. 

I place it in quotes because I would like to revist this project myself to deisgn/develop a better collision system. And fix the animation system that our Lead Designer made so that it doesn't need to interfere with the respawn system.

With this said, I may just start it over from scratch or leave it and move on to newer projects using what I've learned here and elsewhere. 

If you are actually looking here then thank you for taking interest in our project. I hope my future ones keep your interest!
